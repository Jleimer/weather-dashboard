# weather-dashboard
I was able to get the basic functionality of the website, but far from completion.  I struggled to get the arrays to work in my favor.
I just couldnt figure out how to get the 5 day forecast to work with my array to that it appended to every card.  I ran out of time.
I think once I am able to figure out these arrays the rest with be a breeze.  I can get the 5 day forecast but only if I enter the path for every single day. very frustrating.

* when you enter a city and click search the current weather appears.
